# 1k 3d pong
### 3d pong using only a canvas tag & 1k javascript

A 3d pong game I programmed and submitted to the http://js1k.Com/ competition. A competition about javascript scripts no larger than 1k. It's amasing how much you can fit in 1k, when pushing the limits like this. Game programming, geometry, mouse interaction & a full 3d engine!
